I am a young developer with much to learn. My primary interest is in game development, but I didn't arrive at that until fairly recently. After I graduated with my Computer Engineering degree I started my first full-time developer job working mostly with Windows .NET applications in C#. I worked there for about 3 years, during which time I discovered Unity3D. The fact that I was already comfortable with C# and Visual Studio let me dive right in. I loved that I could build prototypes so quickly, and the combination of programming and the Unity client felt so intuitive and powerful. I worked through all the tutorials then started on my own game idea. For a little over a year I used that game to mess around with ideas and learn all sorts of things. Unfortunately I have nothing to show for a lot of them. That game ultimately became Starship Siege, which in its current state is more like a demo of what I've learned.

I decided to stop working on Starship Siege because I wasn't going to ever get it to a "finished" state in my mind. It was stopping me from exploring other ideas. I stopped adding new features, spent some time polishing and release it in its current form.

My goal now is to work on any idea that excites me in hopes of producing a unique asset for the Asset Store or a gameplay mechanic I can build into a future game. I'll also put more effort into documenting my work. I'll be posting more progress videos and tutorials about my learning experiences.

I'm currently employed as a Java developer in Toronto. But if I had the opportunity to work in game development and get paid for it, I would accept in a heartbeat. So if anyone who stumbled upon this wants to make the terrible decision to give me a chance, I'm ready to go!
