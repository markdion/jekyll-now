I am a young developer with much to learn. My primary interest is in game development, but I didn't arrive at that until fairly recently. After I graduated with my Computer Engineering degree I started my first full-time developer job working mostly with Windows .NET applications in C#. This job lasted 3 years, and it was great. I learned a lot about agile development with rapid turn-around times for deliverables. On top of the C#, that job allowed me to gain more experience with C++ and Android. During my time here I was curious about game development, so I started researching and discovered Unity3D right away. The fact that I was already comfortable with C# and Visual Studio let me dive right in. I loved that I could build prototypes so quickly, and the combination of programming and the Unity client felt so intuitive and powerful. I worked through all the tutorials then started on my own game idea. For over a year I used that game to mess around with ideas and learn all sorts of things. Unfortunately I have nothing to show for a lot of them. That game ultimately became Starship Siege; which, in its current state, is more like a demo showcasing some of what I've learned.

I decided to stop working on Starship Siege because I wasn't going to ever get it to a "finished" state I was happy with. I had made the scope too ambitious. It was preventing me from exploring other ideas. I stopped adding new features, spent some time polishing, and released it in its current form.

My goal now is to work on any idea that excites me in hopes of producing a unique asset for the Asset Store or a gameplay mechanic for a future game. I'll also put more effort into documenting my work so I don't forget what I've learned. I'll be posting more progress videos and tutorials for cool stuff.

I'm currently employed as a Java developer in Toronto. But if I had the opportunity to work in game development and get paid for it, I would accept in a heartbeat. So if anyone who stumbled upon this wants to make the terrible decision to give me a chance, I'm ready to go!
